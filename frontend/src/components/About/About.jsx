                <section>
                    I have a passion in programming since very little and I started studying it 
                    extensively in Software University in Sofia. I have acquired a lot of knowledge, 
                    working for a year as a full-stack developer. 
                    I believe that knowing how things work on both sides would make me a better developer. 
                    I am motivated and strive to improve myself by learning new concepts everyday and improving the ones I already know,
                    by doing fullstack projects, which you can see on my github account.
